<h2>Our Idea</h2>




        <p>Our project details the efforts towards anonymous communication between students as a form of support online. This website not only offers a helpful ‘First Aid’ to directly try and help students in the moment of distress, but also works towards building a community online to help people reach out and find common ground within problematic areas at university such as difficulties settling in, housing problems after living in halls and engaging in real, meaningful friendships within limited contact hours with fellow course mates. We have also made sure to include personal accounts of students who have found understanding in relationships and friendships within their personal groups on campus or more specifically within their own course. Although most universities are making efforts to improve mental health awareness and unburden the students of the unnecessary stresses of university life, there is still a major disparity between the realities of university life and the picture perfect image that is presented on university rankings and prospectuses. This website aims to divulge those walls and offers a safe, personal space for all students struggling while in higher education.
