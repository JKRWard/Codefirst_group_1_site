        <h2>Should I, really?</h2>

        <p>I had had doubts for a while, unhappy with a few aspects of my life but convincing myself that objectively I didn’t have reason to complain. I am a mature part-time student with a husband, children and a job and sometimes I felt that it was all getting too much and I wasn’t giving all parts of my life the attention it should get. Mostly I was fine, which is why I never sought help. After a particular day of worrying about achieving a milestone in my studies, I called a friend to talk everything through. This was really helpful because it gave me the opportunity to voice concerns in a defined space, and open the conversation about whether or not my “case” was severe enough to use a service designed for students (undergrads?) in distress (about exams? relationships? being away from home?). My friend suggested that I should contact Student Wellbeing to simply ask the question, and that it might be a good idea to have a few counselling sessions to “steady the ship” with so much going on in my life. This advice gave me the confidence to simply try, and I am happy to have made the step. Although I think the initial appointment with the service should not be called “Assessment appointment”, as I found this really off-putting, especially if your presenting problem is anxiety and excessive worry!
