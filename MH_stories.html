        <h2>Should I, really?</h2>

        <p>I had had doubts for a while, unhappy with a few aspects of my life but convincing myself that objectively I didn’t have reason to complain. I am a mature part-time student with a husband, children and a job and sometimes I felt that it was all getting too much and I wasn’t giving all parts of my life the attention it should get. Mostly I was fine, which is why I never sought help. After a particular day of worrying about achieving a milestone in my studies, I called a friend to talk everything through. This was really helpful because it gave me the opportunity to voice concerns in a defined space, and open the conversation about whether or not my “case” was severe enough to use a service designed for students (undergrads?) in distress (about exams? relationships? being away from home?). My friend suggested that I should contact Student Wellbeing to simply ask the question, and that it might be a good idea to have a few counselling sessions to “steady the ship” with so much going on in my life. This advice gave me the confidence to simply try, and I am happy to have made the step. Although I think the initial appointment with the service should not be called “Assessment appointment”, as I found this really off-putting, especially if your presenting problem is anxiety and excessive worry!

        <h2>Initial Stresses</h2>

        <p> My experience with mental health as an undergraduate at university mainly revolved around the stress in adjusting to a different home for the next three years and the sheer quantity of work that quickly overwhelmed me as we got into the first term. Making friends at university was not the same as it was in high school, and I made furtive attempts at friendships through alienating social hangouts during freshers week. I was fortunate enough to have excellent roommates in my halls who quickly realised that I was struggling and immediately came to my aid with nightly chats and support. The conversations I have had with them have been more important than any of the attempts at health and mental wellbeing projects I have seen on campus- the physical ability to talk to someone about my problems who knew me and who wouldn’t judge were by far the most important.

        <h2>Unexpected Issues</h2>

        <p>By far the biggest shock for me at university and where I struggled most was with the way everyone lost contact with each other after moving away to houses. Friends I had made in first year in halls were now living with new housemates, and mine had been picked last minute, which meant that I was not well integrated with them at all. So gradually during the year after my lectures and seminars I would retract into my room, hiding away into the safety of my laptop, Netflix and lack of human interaction. I was quite involved in my course and the chat rooms that we had made provided essential relief when I needed to talk to someone about a rough day or a particularly tough exam. Without those hours spent typing away in messenger, I would not be able to face spending another year at university, hopefully living with a lot more of my course makes that I can now call friends.
